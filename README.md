# â—² QR Clicker
QR Clicker is a Cookie Clicker clone that was made to fit on a QR Code. That means that the entire game is less than 3KB in size. QR Clicker has 6 different buildings, starting at a handheld scanner and slowly getting more complex and more efficient. Made for the 2025 Say Cheese event in Hack Club.
